BEFORE:

During this first (kinda) real project of mine i'll practise the HTML and GIT skills i've learned so far, i'll be doing that by making a recipe website. 


AFTER:

It was fun to implement what I learned, both with HTML and using GIT in the command line. I'm not sure yet what the correct way to arrange my code is, hopefully i'll find out soon.
I'm also pretty sure that I made too many commits with wrong descriptions but it still felt good to practise with GIT.
